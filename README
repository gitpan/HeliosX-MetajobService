HeliosX-MetajobService version 0.02
===================================

HeliosX::MetajobService is an extension to Helios::Service (through
HeliosX::ExtLoggerService) that allows a Helios application to provide 
simple map/reduce operations.

This is in the early, early stages of development, but I've decided release
early, release often may be the better approach.
